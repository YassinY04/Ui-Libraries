## ✧ Overview

This repository contains a collection of UI libraries written from scratch.  
Each library explores different ideas around layout, animation and interaction.

The goal is not quantity — but **well-designed, readable and reusable UI code**.

**Status:** Active development  
API and behavior may change.

A lightweight UI with fast creation times and reduced visual noise.  
Inspired by older cheat-style layouts — fully reimplemented.

**Example**
```lua
local UILibrary = loadstring(game:HttpGet(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/REPO/main/VectorUI/init.lua"
))()

local window = UILibrary:CreateWindow("UI NAME", "Version") -- Create a new window

local categoryOne = window:CreateCategory("CATEGORY ONE") -- Create a new category
local tabOne = categoryOne:CreateTab("Tab One") -- Create a new tab within thaht category

local sectionOne = tabOne:CreateSection("SECTION #1") -- Create a new section within that tab

local checkbox = sectionOne:CreateCheckbox(
	"Checkbox", -- Label
	true, -- Default value
	function(state)
		print("Checkbox state changed to:", state)
	end -- Callback function
)

-- Visual Seperator. Doesn't have any functions and is purely for visuals.
sectionOne:CreateSeperator()

sectionOne:CreateSlider(
	"Float Slider", -- Label
	0, -- Minimum Value
	10.0, -- Maximum Value
	5, -- Default Value
	{ decimals = 2 , suffix = "F" }, -- Options: decimals, suffix
	function(v) end -- Callback function
)

sectionOne:CreateColorPicker(
	"Accent Color", -- Label
	Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0), -- Default Value
	function(color)
		print(color)
	end -- Callback function
)

local dropdown = sectionOne:CreateDropdown(
	"Mode", -- Label
	{ "Off", "Low", "Medium", "High", "Ultra" }, -- Options
	"Medium", -- Default Value
	function(value)
		print("Selected mode:", value)
	end -- Callback function
)
```

## ✦ Design Philosophy

• visuals are intentional, not decorative  
• animations communicate state  
• APIs should be readable without docs  
• UI code stays UI code — no hidden logic
